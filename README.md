Release of Anticancer Peptide Dataset Integrated from Multiple Databases for Cancer Therapeutics Research

Introduction:
The release of the anticancer peptide dataset represents a significant advancement in cancer therapeutics research, aimed at facilitating the development of novel peptide-based treatments for various cancer types. This dataset is meticulously curated from multiple databases, including CancerPPD, APD3, LAMP, and UniProt, with a special focus on integrating peptides from non-secretory proteins as a negative dataset. By compiling diverse sources of peptide information, this dataset offers a comprehensive resource for researchers to explore the potential of peptides in cancer therapy.

Dataset Description:
The dataset comprises a diverse collection of anticancer peptides derived from various biological sources, encompassing different cancer types and stages. Each peptide is annotated with detailed information, including its sequence, origin, experimental evidence, and relevant references. Furthermore, the dataset includes a carefully curated set of non-secretory proteins, serving as a negative dataset for comparative analysis.

Integration with Cancer Genomic Datasets:
To enhance the utility of the anticancer peptide dataset, researchers can integrate it with cancer genomic datasets such as TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas) and Cancer Genome databases. By correlating peptide sequences with cancer subtypes and genomic alterations, researchers can identify potential therapeutic targets and elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying cancer progression.

Potential Applications:
The integrated dataset enables researchers to explore various applications in cancer therapeutics, including:

Targeted Therapy: By combining peptide sequences with DNA methylation data, researchers can develop targeted therapies that exploit specific methylation patterns associated with cancer subtypes.
Splicing Therapy: Integration with alternate splicing data allows for the identification of splice variants associated with cancer progression, paving the way for splicing-based therapeutic interventions.
De Novo Peptide Design: Leveraging advanced generative models such as LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory), RNN (Recurrent Neural Network), VAE (Variational Autoencoder), and GAN (Generative Adversarial Network), researchers can generate novel anticancer peptides tailored to specific cancer types and genomic profiles.
Conclusion:
The release of the anticancer peptide dataset offers a valuable resource for cancer therapeutics research, providing researchers with access to a comprehensive collection of peptides and facilitating the development of innovative peptide-based treatments. By integrating this dataset with cancer genomic datasets and leveraging advanced computational techniques, researchers can accelerate the discovery of targeted therapies and personalized treatment strategies for cancer patients.


#Dataset Description

We created a anticancer peptide dataset integrating the positive samples with differnet literature, patents and databases such as CancerPPD, LAMP, APD3 etc.
Similarly, the dataset with different CD-HIT were created where CD-HIT 0.90 means that the sample within the dataset with similarity more than 90 were removed using CH-HIT tools.

For more desciptive dataset, we annoted a dataset using CancerPPD and AntiCP2.0 link. These database and the manuscript are referenced in manuscript.
